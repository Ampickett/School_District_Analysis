  * Impact on Scores by school type: We do not see any changes on math or reading scores between charters and districts. Removing the 9th graders scores does show a reduction in charter schools passing percentages. We see that the passing percentages dropped from 90 percent passing overall, down to 87%. Also, math passing % went from 94% to 90%, and reading passing % went from 97% down to 93%. Slight reductions did occur but did not impact the big picture tremendously.
